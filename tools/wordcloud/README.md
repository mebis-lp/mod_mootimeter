# Wordcloud subplugin

This subplugin depends on an external library. To install and deploy it correctly, just run
`npm install` and `npm run deploy-wordcloud`. Note that this will also run the `grunt amd` task
minifying all the JavaScript code in this subplugin, so `grunt` will have to configured properly
in your moodle development environment.
